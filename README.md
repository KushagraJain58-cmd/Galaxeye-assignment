## Steps need to be executed to test the code

### The normal way:

- Connect to the database
- In command promt:
    In one terminal
      - cd backend
      - npm install
      - npm run dev
      - The terminal should look like:
        Connected to MongoDB
        Server Running on port 3500
     In different terminal:
      - cd frontend
      - npm install
      - npm start
